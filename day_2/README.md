# Assignment 2

## Class and Constructor

- Create a class called Person that represents a person, with properties for their name and age. The Person class should have a constructor that takes two parameters: a String for the person's name and an int for their age.
- The constructor should set the initial values of the name and age properties based on the passed-in values.
- Once you have created the Person class and its constructor, create two Person objects: one representing a person named "Alice" who is 25 years old, and another representing a person named "Bob" who is 30 years old.
- Then print out the name and age properties of each Person object.
